async function mineTenGravel(bot) {
    // The routine first ensures the bot has a shovel, crafting an iron shovel if none are present, and places a crafting table if required; it then searches for a gravel block within a reasonable distance, exploring randomly until one is found; once a gravel block is located, the bot moves to a spot next to it; finally it repeatedly mines gravel until the inventory holds at least ten gravel items.
