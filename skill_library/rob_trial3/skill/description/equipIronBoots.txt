async function equipIronBoots(bot) {
    // The function ensures the bot wears iron boots by checking if they are already equipped, locating them in the inventory or gathering enough iron ingots (smelting raw iron with coal if necessary), placing a crafting table at a nearby free spot, moving next to the table, crafting the boots, and finally equipping them on the feet.
