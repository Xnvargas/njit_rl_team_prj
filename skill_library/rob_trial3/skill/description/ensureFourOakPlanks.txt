async function ensureFourOakPlanks(bot) {
    // The routine checks how many oak planks the bot currently holds and, if fewer than four, computes the number of additional planks and corresponding oak logs required; it then verifies that enough oak logs are in the inventory, searching the nearby area and mining extra logs when necessary; next, it ensures a crafting table is available, placing one nearby if none is found; using the gathered logs, it crafts the needed amount of oak planks to reach exactly four; finally, it updates the inventory count to reflect the target quantity.
