async function mineOneWoodLog(bot) {
    // The function ensures the bot obtains a single wood log; it first scans the inventory for any log type and exits if one is already present; if none are found, it searches within 32 blocks for a log and mines it immediately when located; when no nearby log exists, it explores the world in random directions for up to a minute until a log block is detected; upon discovery during exploration, it mines exactly one log of the found type; then the process ends.
