async function craftIronSwordSafe(bot) {
    // The routine first checks the inventory for at least two iron ingots, smelting raw iron with coal if necessary, and aborts if insufficient; it then verifies that a stick is present; it searches for a nearby crafting table and, if none is found, attempts to place one on a suitable solid block adjacent to the bot; once a crafting table is available, it crafts an iron sword using the required materials; finally, it confirms that the iron sword appears in the inventory.
