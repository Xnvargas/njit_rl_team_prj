async function equipIronChestplate(bot) {
    // The function ensures the bot wears an iron chestplate by first looking for the item in its inventory; if absent it searches for the nearest chest within 32 blocks, navigates to it, opens the container, and withdraws one iron chestplate, then attempts to equip it on the torso slot and reports whether the operation succeeded or failed.
