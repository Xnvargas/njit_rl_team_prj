async function smeltExactlyFiveRawIron(bot) {
    // The routine first checks that the inventory contains at least five raw iron and one piece of coal, aborting if not. It then looks for an existing furnace block within range and, if missing, places a furnace next to a suitable solid block. Current counts of iron ingots are recorded before smelting. Exactly five raw iron are smelted using the furnace and coal as fuel. After a short wait for the inventory to update, the function compares pre‑ and post‑smelt quantities to confirm that five raw iron were consumed and five iron ingots were produced.
