async function equipIronLeggings(bot) {
    // The function makes sure the bot is wearing iron leggings. It first searches the inventory for iron leggings, and if none are found it verifies that at least eight iron ingots are available. It then ensures a crafting table is present, placing one if necessary, and crafts the iron leggings. After crafting, it retrieves the newly created item and attempts to equip it in the leg slot. Any errors during equipping are caught and reported.
