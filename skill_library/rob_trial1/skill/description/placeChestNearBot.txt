async function placeChestNearBot(bot) {
    // The function tries to place a chest close to the bot by first detecting any existing chest within a short distance, then verifying that the bot holds a chest item, then searching nearby air blocks with solid ground using random horizontal directions, and if none are found it explores until a suitable spot appears; once a position is identified it places the chest there and finally checks that the chest block was successfully created.
