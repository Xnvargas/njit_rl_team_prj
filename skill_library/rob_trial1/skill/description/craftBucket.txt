    // The routine first checks that the inventory contains at least three iron ingots, smelting raw iron with coal or sticks if necessary; it then ensures a crafting table is within five blocks, placing one on a suitable adjacent air block when none is found; after confirming the table’s presence, it verifies that a bucket is not already owned and proceeds to craft a bucket using the table; finally, it confirms that the newly crafted bucket appears in the inventory.
