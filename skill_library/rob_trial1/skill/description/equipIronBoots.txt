async function equipIronBoots(bot) {
    // The routine ensures the bot has iron boots by first checking the inventory, then attempting to retrieve them from a nearby chest, and finally crafting them if necessary; it verifies that a furnace exists and places one if needed, then smelts raw iron using available fuel to obtain enough iron ingots; it also makes sure a crafting table is present, placing it when absent; after gathering the required materials, it crafts the iron boots and equips them on the feet slot.
