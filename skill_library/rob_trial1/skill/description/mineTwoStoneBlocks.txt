async function mineTwoStoneBlocks(bot) {
    // The function first checks that the bot possesses a stone‑or‑better pickaxe and equips it, then searches for a stone block within a 32‑block radius, exploring randomly for up to 60 seconds if none is initially found; once a stone block is located it mines exactly two stone blocks to produce cobblestone, and finally it confirms that the inventory now contains at least two cobblestone items.
