async function mineFiveCoal(bot) {
    // The function ensures the bot has a usable pickaxe, crafting a stone pickaxe if none is present and sufficient resources exist; it then equips the selected pickaxe, searches for a coal ore block within a 32‑block radius and, if none is found, explores in random horizontal directions until coal ore is discovered or a timeout occurs; once coal ore is located, it mines at least five coal ore blocks; after mining, it checks the inventory to confirm that at least five coal items were obtained; the overall process guarantees the bot acquires a minimum of five coal pieces.
